# Stata code for running a simple simulation study
The files contained in this repository are provided for for readers of [Morris, White and Crowther's tutorial paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sim.8086) to run the example simulation study described in section 7.

There is one folder containing Stata code and another folder containing R code. Each folder contains the relevant readme. I would be delighted to see code for running this simulation study in other languages, but do not plan to write it myself.
